 3. Fixes occasional false over power shutdown and display of warning message.
## Configuration S1.177_QT1.50
 1. Temperature Setpoint resolution is now 0.1 mK
 2. Fixes measured temperature corruption issue when using a non-zero Steinhart-Hart C coefficient.
 3. Fixes meter lockup when invalid Steinhart-Hart coefficients are entered
 4. Implements ***IDN?** Serial API command
   
       Returns:
    
       __Vescent Photonics, SLICE-`<model>`, `<serial number>`, `<System Controller FW Version>`, `<ICE2 FW Version>`__  
       __NOTE:__ For SLICE QTC models which were originally shipped with Version S1.24_QTC1.38 firmware, contact Vescent for  
                 assistance in loading the device serial number.
       
  5. Allows exiting a rotary knob edit by touching outside of the active rotary edit box
  6. Fixes occasional -0.0 display on error readout
  7. Adds automatic shutdown with error summary when device maximum power is exceeded.
  8. Adds **Setpoint Relative** external input mode which allows adjustment of the base temperature setpoint from the main or channel summary screen  
  9. Adds **INPUTA, INPUTB, OUTPUT1, and OUTPUT2** serial API commands. See [SLICE-QTC API](https://www.vescent.com/manuals/doku.php?id=slice:qt:api) for instructions  
  10. Adds shutdown of all menus and return to main screen when a FAULT condition is detected  
  11. Fixes Actual Temperature not updating after thermistor coefficients are changed  
  12. Fixes Rotary Edit freeze at 0.0. (Previous versions would freeze the value at 0.0 if the user continued to turn the rotary knob counter clockwise upon reaching 0.0. The user would have to exit and re-enter the rotary edit mode or use the keypad entry to increase the value.)
